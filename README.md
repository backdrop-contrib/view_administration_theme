View administration theme
=========================

This module provides the `view administration theme` permission that was removed
in Backdrop version 1.17.0.

This permission was added to Drupal 7 with the addition of the Overlay module,
which was removed from Backdrop in `1.0.0`.

There is a small chance that there is a Backdrop or Drupal 7 site that makes
use of this permission separate from the Overlay module. This module provides
the permission.
